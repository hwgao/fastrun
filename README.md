dm
============================

This is a simple bash script used to create a favorite directories list for bash.

ds -- used to save the current directory into the list

dv -- use vi to view and edit the list

dm -- show the list and prompt the user to choose a directory to change to

Notes:

This file should be sourced in the .bashrc, or copy the content of dm.sh into .bashrc and source .bashrc

Todo:

Maybe it will be more convient to support the alias of a directory, but I don't want to make this simple tool too complex.
